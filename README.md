# Aviation Accident Analysis  
  
## Overview  
  
This repository contains an analysis of historical aviation accident data, focusing on investigating trends, identifying key risk factors, and providing actionable business recommendations. The analysis is based on a detailed PowerPoint presentation titled **"Aviation Accident Data Analysis"** by Abigail Muthenya, which outlines the project goals, data sources, methodologies, visualizations, and findings.  
  
## Business Understanding  
  
The main objective of this analysis is to evaluate different aircraft models to determine those with the lowest operational and safety risks. This analysis helps stakeholders make informed, strategic decisions when expanding into the aviation industry.   
  
**Stakeholders:**  
- Aviation company executives and strategy teams  
- Safety and risk management professionals  
- Regulatory bodies and aviation authorities  
  
**Key Business Questions:**  
- How have accident trends evolved over time?  
- Which aircraft models are associated with higher fatality counts?  
- What common flight purposes are linked to aviation accidents?  
  
The presentation provides a clear business context and outlines these questions, thereby aligning the analysis with the decision-making needs of the stakeholders.  
  
## Data Understanding and Analysis  
  
### Source of Data  
The data originates from historical aviation accident records, compiled over several decades. It includes details on accident events such as dates, aircraft makes, fatal injuries, flight purposes, weather conditions, and more. The dataset has been rigorously cleaned to handle duplicates and missing values, ensuring reliability in the subsequent analysis.  
  
### Description of Data  
- **Temporal Scope:** Several decades of aviation accident data.  
- **Key Variables:** Accident dates, aircraft model identification, injury counts (including fatal injuries), flight purposes, and additional contextual information.  
- **Data Quality:** The dataset underwent cleaning to remove duplicates and address missing values, contributing to more robust analysis outcomes.  
  
### Analysis and Visualizations  
  
Three primary visualizations support the findings, mirroring what was presented in the slides and accompanying notebook:  
- **Accidents Over Time:** A time-series visualization showcasing the trend of aviation accidents across multiple decades.

These charts serve to visually represent the trends and key factors influencing aviation accident risk and contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying data.  
  
## Conclusion  
  
The analysis provides several key takeaways:  
- A clear trend in aviation accidents over time, highlighting periods of increased or decreased incident frequency.  
- Identification of specific aircraft models linked to higher fatality counts, suggesting areas that require enhanced safety measures.  
- Insights into flight purposes most frequently associated with accidents, supporting contextual evaluations for operational improvements.  
  
In summary, this project not only advances our understanding of aviation safety risks but also offers actionable recommendations for reducing accident occurrences and improving overall operational safety. The presentation and accompanying data-driven analysis can serve as a foundation for future studies and real-time predictive analytics in the aviation sector.
